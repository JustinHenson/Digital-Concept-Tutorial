## The storage of the system is what all the data is saved to. If you download Google Chrome, that data is saved to your storage device. There are two common types of storage used for a computer; Hard Disk Drive and Solid State Drive.
The image above is a Hard Disk Drive (HDD for short), and it works by having a disk that physically spins, and there is an arm that runs across the disk to either read or write data. The other kind of storage is a Solid State Drive (SSD for short), and that works by having chips of storage called NAND, which is made up of tiny transistors that can be used to store data. There is very little latency when accessing data from a SSD, while the HDD has quite a bit of latency due to the mechanical moving parts that make up that storage type. Both storage types connect to the Motherboard via SATA connection. This SATA connection allows the system to access the information on the drive, as well store data onto the drive.
