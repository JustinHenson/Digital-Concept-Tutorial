## RAM or Random Access Memory is accessed by the processor when the processor needs to utilize information very quickly. Several examples of this include:
- Google Chrome
- Spotify
- Skype
- Operating Systems
- Gaming
- Photo and Video editing

### The reason these applications utilize the RAM is because the RAM stores all necessary information for the program to run.
For example, working with a 10 minute 4k Video using Adobe Premiere, the system has to be able to access all the video information, as well as any edits, filters, cuts, or color grading that is done to the video. That is why often you can inspect a video editiing machine that will have 64GB or more of RAM, and when in use, the program will utilize 90% of that memory.
