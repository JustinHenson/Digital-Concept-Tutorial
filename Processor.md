The processor is the brain of the computer, taking information in and translating the information or data into material that can be easily read and understood. Some applications that really work the processor include:
- Gaming
- AutoCAD (2D or 3D design software)
- Video Decoding (Rendering high resolution video)
- Mathematical Software (Such as Excel, Wolfram Calculator, etc.)

## Everything that is done on a computer utlizes the CPU, but some software programs utilize it more than others. Often times when doing engineering or design work, it is recommended that you purchase a machine that has a high end processor, such as an Intel i7 or i9, or an AMD Ryzen 7 or Ryzen 9. The difference in lower end v.s. higher end CPU's include:
- Core count ( This dictates how many instructions a processor can processor at one time)
- Clock Speed ( Clock speed dictates how fast the processor can run the set of instructions)
- Thread Count ( Threads are used in applications that utilize mulitple sets of instructions that can be rendered out at the same time)
- Architecture ( The phyisical layout and design of the processor can dictate how it interacts with hardware such as RAM or storage)

### Generally speaking, the more cores and threads a processor has, the better the processor will perform in certain applications. An important note is that with new design of processors, there isn't as much of need with the core count, but the design of the processor, and how the software utilizes the power of the processor.
