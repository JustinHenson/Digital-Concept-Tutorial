This is an example of what a motherboard looks like. There are a lot of functions that the motherboard is in charge of, including:
- Power Delivery
- Communication between the Processor and everything else on the board (such as RAM, Storage, Graphics, etc.)
- Connectivity of peripherals (i.e. mouse, keyboard, monitors, speakers, etc.)

### Differences in motherboards include:
- Number of power phases (how clean and steady the power distribution is)
- Channels of RAM (how much RAM can be installed and how the RAM interacts with the processor)
- Number of PCI-E slots (Used to install Graphics Cards, Network Cards, Sound Cards, additional USB's, etc.)
- How money Input/Output slots (Number of USB's, support for onboard sound cards, HDMI outputs, etc.)
- Number of SATA connections (Used to for connection Hard Disk Drives or Solid State Drives)
